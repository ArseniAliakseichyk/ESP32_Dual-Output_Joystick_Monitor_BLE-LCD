# ESP32 Joystick BLE Monitor

This project uses an ESP32 board and two joysticks. It shows joystick positions on a small LCD screen and also sends data using Bluetooth (BLE). A Python script can read this data and show it in the terminal with simple graphics.

üÜï The code is now modular. It is split into folders for LCD, BLE, input, and main logic.

## ‚úÖ What it does
- Reads joystick X/Y positions and button
- Shows numbers and moving dots on LCD screen
- Sends joystick data with Bluetooth (BLE)
- Displays real-time data in terminal using Python
- Modular structure in both C and Python

## üì¶ What you need

- ESP32 board  
- 1.8" TFT LCD (160x128)  
- 2 analog joysticks  
- Wires and breadboard  
- Computer with Python 3.9+ and BLE support

## üñ•Ô∏è Python BLE Console Monitor

You can view the joystick data in your terminal using the Python script.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run it

1. Go to the `monitor/` folder
2. Install Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r .\python-code\requirements.txt
```
3. Run the monitor:
```bash
python .\python-code\visualization-j.py
```

It will find the BLE device and show joystick data as numbers and moving dots using `curses`.

## üöÄ How to Start

1. Connect wires to ESP32 (see table above)
2. Build and flash code using ESP-IDF:
```bash
idf.py build
idf.py flash
```
3. Open serial monitor or BLE app
4. Optionally, use the Python script to monitor in terminal

## üí¨ Easy Explanation

"This project reads two game sticks with ESP32. It shows values and moving dots on a small screen. It also sends data to the computer with Bluetooth. A Python program shows this data live in the terminal."
